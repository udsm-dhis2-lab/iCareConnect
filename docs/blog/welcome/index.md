## iCare EMR & Hospital Services System

:::info

### Introduction
iCare is an Electronic Medical Recording and Hospital Services System started October 2020 aiming at addressing common challenges encountered when UDSM   DHIS2 project was providing support to the Ministry of Health on various areas mainly on two areas, integrations between existing hospital systems (Interoperability) and HMIS Data warehouse, also on improving features on the hospital system used by referral hospitals in Tanzania.
Technology
iCare is an OpenSource Technology built on top of OPENMRS as an OpenSource EMR system. Going down, iCare is built taking advantage of the AOP programming paradigm under Spring-Boot technology for the backend and using Angular-12 on the frontend.
:::

To simplify the deployment process specifically on setting up the system up and running, which is also a challenge we encountered during deployment of one of MoHCDGEC EMR systems, iCare uses Docker technology. With the iCare Docker image, there is NO need for server expertise when deploying it.

#### Status (Where are we)
